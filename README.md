# MSFTBandApp

Microsoft Band application created using Xamarin and MSFTBandLib.

This application is a native re-implementation of the Microsoft Band app for mobile devices, using a reverse-engineering of the Microsoft Band's proprietary Bluetooth protocol to enable users to keep using the Band after official support ends on May 31, 2019.
