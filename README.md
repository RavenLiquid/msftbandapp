# MSFTBandApp

Microsoft Band application created using Xamarin and MSFTBandLib.

This application is a native re-implementation of the Microsoft Band app for mobile devices, using a reverse-engineering of the Microsoft Band's proprietary Bluetooth protocol.

**Update 22-10-2019** As may be evident from the activity (or rather, the lack thereof) in the repository over the past few months, development of this project has ceased. This is due primarily to the fact that my final Band has suffered its inevitable hardware failure and so my ability to continue development is limited and I find little value in doing so when I no longer have access to a functioning Band. You are welcome to continue developing the project on the foundations I have laid if you still have a Band on your wrist. I do not currently plan to complete any further work in this repository.
