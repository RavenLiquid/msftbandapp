				<p>MSFTBandApp is a third-party Microsoft Band app developed to allow Microsoft Band owners to continue using their devices beyond the official end of support in May 2019.</p>
				<p>This app is currently in very early development and is highly experimental. Please see the news feed below for details on the status of the project.</p>
				<p>The long-term aim is to achieve feature parity with the official Microsoft Band app, prior to its demise, with builds available for UWP and Android and hardware support for Microsoft Band 1 (Cargo) and Microsoft Band 2 (Envoy).</p>
				<p>This app is developed using the <a href="https://ilmiont.github.io/msftbandlib">MSFTBandLib</a> third-party Microsoft Band SDK implementation, which is also created by this author.</p>

				<p><strong>Update 22/10/2019</strong></p>
				<p>As may be evident from the activity (or rather, the lack thereof) in the repository over the past few months, development of this project has ceased.</p>
				<p>This is due primarily to the fact that my final Band has suffered its inevitable hardware failure and so my ability to continue development is limited and I find little value in doing so when I no longer have access to a functioning Band.</p>
				<p>You are welcome to continue developing the project on the foundations I have laid if you still have a Band on your wrist. I do not currently plan to complete any further work in this repository.</p>
